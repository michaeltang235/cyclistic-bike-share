# Cyclistic bike share case study:
The case study of Cyclistic, a bike-share company in Chicago, aims to explore differences in bike usage between two types of riders - casual and member riders, over the period of May 2022 to April 2023. 
Casual riders refer to customers who purchase single-ride or full-day passes, while member riders refer to customers who purchase annual memberships. In this repository, bike share data in every month
were cleaned and transformed to structured dataframes (or tables), which contain information related to ride lengths, ride counts, and start station names for each type of riders. The scripts were written 
in Python, R, and SQL, and they can be found under the corresponding subdirectory (i.e. code_py, code_r, and code_sql). In each subdirectory, scripts were named with keywords such as 'process', 'analysis',
and 'plot' to denote the relevant stages of data-driven decision making introduced in the Google Data Analytics course. Also, plots depicting insights derived from analysis of bike share data are stored 
under plots_py and plots_r, depending on the programming languages used. In addition, a dashboard showcasing the insights in ridership behavior between rider types is available on Tableau Public, with the
